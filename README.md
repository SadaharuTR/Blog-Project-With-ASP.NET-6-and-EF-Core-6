# Blog-Project-With-ASP.NET-6-and-EF-Core-6
(OnGoing) A Blog Project which I may turned it into only API in future.

Necessary changes planning in future:
- Recent Posts needs to be designed.
- Password change, saving with empty-null areas causes the code blow-up. Need to fix the algorithm.
- Design changes. Background picture, area colors. Carousel on the main page with random images.
- Media links are broken.
- Allowing people to customize their texts before posting it.
  


This project is based on the video lecture series of Cem Keskin with some changes and new designs.
